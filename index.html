          <p> Did you know Chicken Manchurian is not Chinese in origin? It was first introduced in Calcutta, a city of India, by Nelson Wang. The Chinese style batter-fried chicken dunked in sweet and sour gravy was wedded with Indian spices, an extra burst of garlic, and soy sauce. Soon the dish was famous all over the city and similarly, many other pseudo-Indo-Chinese recipes were created to meet the Indian taste buds with fancy names. A vegetarian version of this dish called cauliflower or Gobi Manchurian is very famous. </p>

          <p>Have you heard of Chicken 65? The best version of fried Indian Chicken— you’ll ever have. This is a super easy and super famous Indian chicken starter. Unlike other fried chicken that becomes dry upon cooling. Chicken 65 is a winner because, after frying, we season the chicken with aromatic spices and tomato sauce; this keeps the chicken juicy.
              A.M Buhari invented and introduced this chicken in Buhari Restaurant in Chennai, Tamil Naidu, India.</p>
