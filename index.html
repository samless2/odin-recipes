          <p> Did you know Chicken Manchurian is not Chinese in origin? It was first introduced in Calcutta, a city of India, by Nelson Wang. The Chinese style batter-fried chicken dunked in sweet and sour gravy was wedded with Indian spices, an extra burst of garlic, and soy sauce. Soon the dish was famous all over the city and similarly, many other pseudo-Indo-Chinese recipes were created to meet the Indian taste buds with fancy names. A vegetarian version of this dish called cauliflower or Gobi Manchurian is very famous. </p>
