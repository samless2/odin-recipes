        <li><b>Steps for Chicken : </b></li>
         <ol>
          <li>Put all the ingredients to marinate the chicken in a bowl except oil and mix well.</li>
          <li>Set aside and let it marinate for 30 minutes.</li>
          <li>Now, heat just 2 tablespoon oil in a non- stick pan and stir fry half of the marinated chicken on high heat for 2-3 minutes until color turns white and chicken is cooked. </li>
          <li>Remove the chicken to a plate. Now add another 2 tablespoons of old and stir fry remaining chicken similarly. Set aside until gravy is ready.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><b>Steps for Munchurian Sauce</b></li>
          <ol>
            <li>This simple Manchurian sauce is made of ketchup, red chili, garlic, soy sauce, capsicum, and cornflour slurry.</li>
            <li>While chicken marinates, prepare the Manchurian gravy. In a pot or wok, heat oil and add garlic and dried red button chilli. ( you can use any other dry red chilli too)</li>
            <li>Add Ketchup, chilli garlic sauce, capsicum, chicken stock cube, and soy sauce. You may use less or more soy sauce depending upon its potency.</li>
            <li>Add water and mix well.</li>
            <li>Mix cornflour and water in a bowl to make a slurry and add to the Manchurian sauce to thicken the gravy. Keep cooking on low heat and stir constantly to avoid lumps until gravy is thickened</li>
            <li>Add chicken munch to the gravy. </li>
            <li>Now Manchurian is moderate to the very spicy gravy. So I recommend adding black pepper first then do a taste test and add red chili powder as needed to match your heat preference</li>
            <li>Garnish with green onions and serve Chicken Manchurian </li>
